## Signature Authentication & Verification

### Signature Guide

Considering that API requests may get tampered in the process of transmission, to keep the transmission secure, you have to use your API Key to do Signature Authentication for all private interface except for public interface (used for acuqiring basic information and market data), in this way to verify whether the parameters/ parameter value get tampered or not in the process of transmission

A legitimate request consists of following parts：

- Request address of method, i.e. visit server address--api.hbdm.com, e.g.:  api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order

- API Access Key ID (AccessKeyId): Access Key of the API Key that you apply.

- Method of Signature (SignatureMethod): Based on the Hash Aggrement, users calculate the signature via HmacSHA256.

- Signature Version (SignatureVersion): It adopts version 2 in terms of Signature Version.

- Timestamp (Timestamp): The time when you send the request (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone) : (UTC time zone), e.g.: 2017-05-11T16:22:06

- Must-fill parameters & optional parameters: For each method, there are a group of must-fill parameters and optional parameters used to address the API request, which can be found in the illustration of each method as well as their meaning. Please note that, in terms of "Get" requests, it needs to do Signature calculation for all the original parameters in each method ; In terms of "Post" requests, no need to do Signature calculation for the original parameters in each method, which means only four parameters need to do Signature calculation in "Post" requests, i.e. AccessKeyId, SignatureMethod, SignatureVersion, Timestamp with other parameters placed in "body".

- Signature: The result of Signature calculation which is used to verify if signature is valid and not tampered.


### Create API Key

<a href='https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/'>You could  create API Key at</a>

API Key consists of the following two parts.

- "Access Key", the Key used to visit API.
  
- "Secret Key", the Key used to do Signature authentication and verification (visible during application period).

<aside class="notice">
When create API Key, users could bind IP address, as the validity of unbond IP address is only 90 days.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
API Key has operation authorization of trading, borrowing, deposit and withdrawal etc..
</aside>
<aside class="warning">
Both Access Key and Secret Key are closely related with account security, please do not disclose them to others for any reasons anytime.
</aside>


### Steps for Signature

Normative request for Signature calculation Different contents will get totally different results when use HMAC to calculate Signature, therefore, please normalize the requests before doing Signature calculation. Take the request of inquering order details as an example:

query details of one order 

`https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15:19:30`

#### 1. Request methods (GET/POST): add line breaker "\n".


`POST\n`

#### 2. Text the visit address in lowercase, adding line breake "\n"

`
api.hbdm.com\n
`

#### 3. Visit the path of methods, adding line breaker "\n"

`
/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n
`

#### 4. Rank the parameter names according to the sequence of ASCII codes, for example, below is the parameters in original sequence and the new sequence:


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

<aside class="notice">
Use UTF-8 to encode when it has already been encoded by URI with hexadecimals in Uppercase, e.g., ":" wiil be encoded to "%3A" while space to "%20".
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
Timestamp should be written in the form of YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss and encoded with URI.
</aside>


#### 5. After ranking

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 6.  Following the sequence above, link parameters with "&"


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

#### 7. Form the final character strings that need to do Signature calculation as following:

`POST\n`

`api.hbdm.com\n`

`/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order\n`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`


#### 8. Use the "request character strings" formed in the last step and your Secret Key to create a digital Signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

1. Take the request character string formed in the last step and API Secret Key as two parameters, encoding them with the Hash Function HmacSHA256 to get corresponding Hash value.

2. Encoding the Hash value with base-64 code, the result will be the digital Signature of this request.

#### 9. Add the digital Signature into the parameters of request path.

The final request sent to Server via API should be like:

`https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`

1. Add all the must authentication parameters into the parameters of request path;

2. Add the digital Signature encoded with URL code into the path parameters with the parameter name of "Signature".

## API Rate Limit Illustration

Future, Coin Margined Swap and USDT Margined Swap are using separate API rate limits.

Please note that, for both public interface and private interface, there are rate limits, more details are as below:

* Generally, the private interface rate limit of API key is at most 72 times every 3 seconds for each UID (Trade Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds. Read Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds) (this rate limit is shared by all the altcoins contracts delivered by different date).<a href= https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#api-list > API Interface List </a>

* For public interface used to get information of index, price limit, settlement, delivery, open positions and so on, the rate limit is 120 times every 3 second at most for each IP (this 120 times every 3 second public interface rate limit is shared by all the requests from that IP of non-marketing information, like above).

* For public interface to get market data such as  Get Kline data, Get Market Data Overview, Get Contract Information,Get market in-depth data, Get premium index Kline, Get real-time forecast capital rate kline, Get basis data, Get the last Trade of a Contract and so on：
 
    （1）For restful interfaces, products,  (future, coin margined swap, usdt margined swap)800 times/second for one IP at most

    （2）For websocket: The rate limit for “req” request is 50 times at once. No limit for “sub” request as the data will be pushed by sever voluntarily.

* WebSocket, the private order push interface, requires API KEY Verification:

    Each UID can build at most create 30 WS connections for private order push at the same time. For each account, 
    contracts of the same underlying coin only need to subscribe one WS order push, e.g. users only need to create one WS 
    order push connection for BTC Contract which will automatically push orders of BTC-USDT
    contracts. Please note that the rate limit of WS order push and RESTFUL private interface are separated from each other, with no relations.

* Both read and trade interfaces will return the ratelimit info.You can refer to the following fields of "header" from api response. E.g.,you will get the total Read ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Read ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you query the order info(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_account_info) , and you will get the total Trade ratelimit("ratelimit-limit") and the remaining Trade ratelimit("ratelimit-remaining") when you place an order(/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order)). <a href= https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#api-list > API Interface List </a> 

* Will response following string for "header" via api 

    ratelimit-limit: the upper limit of requests per time, unit: times

    ratelimit-interval: reset interval (reset the number of request), unit: ms

    ratelimit-remaining: the left available request number for this round, unit: times

    ratelimit-reset: upper limit of reset time used to reset request number, unit: ms 

    When API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio is triggered,the following string for "header" via api will also be returned:

    recovery-time: recovery timestamp, whose unit is millisecond, showing the end time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp;

    if you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in returned header;

## API Limitation on Order Cancellation Ratio

* The system will calculate the order cancellation ratio automatically when the total number of orders placed via certain order price types by the API user goes equal to or larger than 3,000 within 10 minutes. If the order cancellation ratio is greater than 99%, the user will be prohibited for 5 minutes from placing orders via certain API order price types which will be listed below (The response of placing orders will return: 1084  Your contract API is disabled, please try again after {0} (GMT+8).).
* A 30-minute API order placement prohibition will be triggered if the user was prohibited for 3 times within an hour (The response of placing orders will return: 1084  Your contract API is disabled, please try again after {0} (GMT+8).). After resuming access, the total number of prohibited times will be cleared during the previous period and will not be counted into the total prohibited times in the new period.
* Please note that the prohibition from placing orders will cause no effect on order cancellation via API as well as order placement and cancellation via other terminals. We’ll keep you notified on each prohibition via SMS and email.
* Only four API order price types will be prohibited which are Limit order, Post_only, FOK and IOC. Please note that you can still use freely other order price types during the banned period, such as Lightning Close, BBO, Optimal 5, Optimal 10 and Optimal 20, opponent_ioc, lightning_ioc, optimal_5_ioc, optimal_10_ioc，optimal_20_ioc，opponent_fok，lightning_fok，optimal_5_fok，optimal_10_fok，optimal_20_fok,etc.
- The response header returned by HTTP request:
    - When placing order by using the four prohibited order price types during the prohibition period, the message header returned by interface will include the field: "recovery-time: recovery timestamp" whose unit is millisecond, showing the end time of prohibition, or the access retrieval timestamp; if you are not in the prohibition period, the field is not included in returned header;
    - Please note that our system calculates order cancellation ratio according to UID and therefore, the master account UID and sub-accounts UIDs will be counted separately. The calculation period is 10 min/time(The start time starts at 00:00 and the end time is 00:10. Every 10 minutes is a cycle.).
- Definition of Indicators：
  
  - Order Cancellation Ratio =Total number of invalid cancellation / Total number of placed orders (all types of orders placed via API) 
  - Total number of placed order: Total number of placed orders refers to all orders placed via API which meet these requirements:
    - 1.the order type is placing orders (Order Type = 1),
    - 2.order price types include Limit Order, Post_only, FOK and IOC.
    - 3.order creating time should be within the interval between 3 seconds before the start time of the calculation period and the end time of the calculation period.
  - Total number of invalid cancellation:Total number of invalid cancellation refers to all cancellation orders placed via API which meet the requirements.

    - the order type is placing orders (order Type=1),
    - the order price types are Limit Order, post_only, FOK and IOC.
    - the order status is “Orders cancelled” (status=7).
    - order with 0 fulfilled.
    - the interval between order cancellation and placement should be less than or equal to 3 seconds.
    - the order cancellation time should be within the calculation period.
  
- In order to ensure stability and transaction performance of API, please try to reduce order cancellation rate and cancellation amount during peak periods to avoid frequent triggering of API restriction mechanism.Suggestions of reducing order cancellation rate are as below:

  - 1. Set orders’ price to BBO prices as close as possible;

  - 2. Prolong the interval properly between each order placement and cancellation;

  - 3. Try to increase your amount for each order and reduce the frequency of order;

  - 4. Try to improve your order fulfillment rate:

    - （1）Please try to use order prices types that help more on order fulfillment in preference such as BBO, Optimal 5, Optimal 10, Optimal 20, lightning Close, opponent_ioc, lightning_ioc, optimal_5_ioc, optimal_10_ioc，optimal_20_ioc，opponent_fok，lightning_fok，optimal_5_fok，optimal_10_fok，optimal_20_fok, etc.

    - （2）Try to use best bid/ask price when placing IOC orders, FOK orders and Post_only orders.

  - 5. Please try to extend your request polling cycle when implementing your strategy.
 
## Maintenance with service suspended
During the maintenance of the business system, in addition to the below two interfaces(<a href='https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#get-system-status'>Get system status</a >, <a href='https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#query-whether-the-system-is-available'>Query whether the system is available</a >) for users to query the system status, all “rest” interfaces of the API business will return this in a fixed manner:`{"status": "maintain"}`. During maintenance with service suspended，all websocket notify interfaces except subscribing system status updates（<a href='https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#general-subscribe-system-status-updates'>Subscribe system status updates</a>）can't work，and will push 1006 error code to clients.

## API Best Practice

### 1. Query contract history orders interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders

- To ensure timelines and to reduce latency, users are highly recommended to get contract history orders information faster from server memory using interface “query contract order information” (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info).

- For users who use interface “query contract history orders” (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders), please enter as many query conditions as possible (including contract_code, trade_type（recommended to send “0” to query all）, type, status, create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.

 

### 2. Query contract match results interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_matchresults

- To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying conditions as possible (including contract_code, trade_type（recommended to send “0” to query all）, create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.

 

### 3. Query contract financial record interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_financial_record

- To improve query performance and response speed, please enter as many querying conditions as possible (including symbol, type(recommended to leave it blank to query all), create_date). Besides, try not to enter a big integer in parameter “create_date”. You are kindly suggested to query one-day data at a time.

 

### 4. Query contract order detail interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail

- When querying orders without parameter(such as the parameter: created_at), the query result data may be delayed. It is recommended to pass the two parameters of the interface: created_at (order timestamp) and order_type (order type, default 1), the database will be directly queried, and the query results data will be more timely.

- Querying condition “created_at” uses 13-bit long type time stamp (including milliseconds). Querying performance will be improved when accurate time stamps are entered.

- For example: the converted time stamp of "2019/10/18 10:26:22" is 1571365582123. The returned ts from interface “contract_order” can be used as time stamp to query corresponding order. 0 is not allowed in parameter “created_at”.


### 5. WebSocket subscription to Market Depth data:

- For acquiring market depth data within 150 steps, you are kindly suggested to use step0, step1, step2, step3, step4, step5, step14, step15, step16, step17；

- For acquiring market depth data within 20 steps, you are kindly suggested to use step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13, step18, step19；

- Since the large volume of pushing 150 steps data every 100ms, WebSocket disconnection may occur frequently if client’s network bandwidth is insufficient or the processing is not in time; therefore, we highly recommend users using step6, step7, step8, step9, step10, step11, step12, step13, step18, step19 to acquire 20 steps data. For instance, subscribing 20 steps data.

`{`

  `"sub": "market.BTC-USDT.depth.step6",`

  `"id": "id5"`

`}`

- We also suggest that you subscribe incremental market depth data.orderbook event will be checked every 30ms. If there is no orderbook event, you will not receive any orderbook data.you HAVE TO maintain local orderbook data,such as updating your local orderbook bids and asks data.You can subscribe 20 or 150 unmerged data.

`{`

  `"sub": "market.BTC-USDT.depth.size_20.high_freq",`

` "data_type":"incremental", `

` "id": "id1" `

`}`

### 6. Place order interface (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order) and place a batch of orders interface (URL:/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_batchorder):

- We recommend to fill in the parameter “client_order_id”(should be unique from user-side),which can help users to acquire order status and other order information according to the parameter “client_order_id" from

- query order information interface (URL: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info ) when there is no returned information due to network or other problems.

### 7. The best deployment of program server

- It is recommended that place the server in AWS Tokyo C zone and use the api.hbdm.vn domain, which can effectively reduce network disconnection and network timeout.

# Swap API FAQ

## Access and Authentication

### Q1: Is the API Key  for swap and spot the same ?
     
Yes. The Swap API key and spot API key are same. You can create API using the following link.<a href=https://www.hbg.com/zh-cn/apikey/> click here</a>

### Q2: Why are APIs  disconnected or timeout?

1. The network connection is unstable if the server locates in China mainland,it is suggested to invoke APIS from a server located in  1c area of AWS Tokyo.

2.  You can use api.btcgateway.pro or api.hbdm.vn to debug for China mainland  network.

### Q3: Why is the websocket often disconnected?

It seems that most of the abnormal websocket  issues (such as disconnect, websocket close )(websocket: close 1006 (abnormal closure))are caused by different network environment. The following measures can effectively reduce websocket issues.

It would be better if the server is located in 1c area of AWS Tokyo with url api.hbdm.vn and implement websocket re-connection mechanism. Both market heartbeat and order heartbeat should response with Pong with different format, following  Websocket market heartbeat and account heartbeat requirement.<a href=https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#market-heartbeat>here</a>

### Q4:  what is the difference between api.hbdm.com and api.hbdm.vn?

The api.hbdm.vn uses AWS's CDN service. it should be more stable and faster for AWS users. The api.hbdm.com uses Cloudflare's CDN service.

### Q5: What is the colocation service ? which attention points should we know ?

Actually ,colo corresponds to a vpc node, which directly connects to  private network of huobi's future, so it will reduce the latency between the client and the Huobi future server (bypassing the CDN)

huobi future and huobi swap have the same colo, so the domain name connecting the USDT Margined swap api and the future api are the same.

Note : Colo needs to use api.hbdm.com for signature(authentication) to avoid getting 403 error: Verification failure. 

### Q6: Why does signature verification return failure (403: Verification failure) ?

The signature process of USDT Margined swap is similar to huobi future and coin margined swap . In addition to the following precautions,please refer to the swap or future demo to verify whether the signature is successful. Please check your own signature code after demo verification is successful. The coin margined  swap code demo is <a href=https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/coin_margined_swap/v1/en/#code-demo>here</a>. The future code demo is <a href=https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/dm/v1/en/#code-demo>here</a>. The USDT Margined Swap code demo is <a href=https://docs.huobigroup.com/docs/usdt_swap/v1/en/#code-demo>here</a>.

1. Check if the API key is valid and copied correctly.
2. Check if the IP is in whitelist
3. Check if th timestamp is UTC time
4. Check if parameters are sorted alphabetically
5. Check if the encoding is UTF-8 
6. Check if the signature has base64 encoding
7. Any method with parameters for GET requests should be signed
8. Any method with parameters for POST requests don't need to be signed
9. Check if whether the signature is URI encoded and Hexadecimal characters must be capitalized, such as ":" should be encoded as "%3A", and the space shoule be encoded as "%20"
10. The authorization of websocket is similar to the authorization of restful interface.Pls note that the json body of the websocket authorization shouldn't be URL encoded
11. The host in signature text should be the same as the host in your API request.The proxy may change the request host, you can try without proxy;Some http/websocket library may include port in the host, you can try to append port in signature host, like "api.hbdm.com:443"
12. The hidden text in API Key and Secret Key may have impact on the signature.
13. Check the byte[] is directly to be Base64 encoded after generated from the HmacSHA256 signature, instead of hexadecimal string to be Base64 encoded.

If the reason for signature failure has not been found through the above methods. And you can confirm that by this <a href='https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_api_rules '>  demo </a > which is specially explaining the signature.

### Q7: Is the ratelimit of public market based on  IP ? Is the ratelimit of interface with  private key based on UID?

Yes. The ratelimit of interface with private key is based on the UID, not the API key. The master and sub accounts are separately ratelimited and don't affect each other.

### Q8: Is there any recommendation for third-party framework which integrates Huobi swap?

There is an open source asynchronous quantization framework which integrates Huobi future and Huobi swap: <a href=https://github.com/hbdmapi/hbdm_Python>here</a>. If you have any quetsions, please open a ticket in github issues.

## Settlement 

### Q1: What is the USDT Margined Swap funding rate settlement cycle? Which interface can be used to check the status when the fund rate is settled? 

We warmly remind you that Huobi USDT Margined Swap is settled every 8 hours, and the settlement will be at the end of each period. For example, 00:00 - 08:00 is a period, and its settlement time would be at 08:00; 08:00 - 16:00 is a period, and its settlement time would be at 16:00; 16:00 - 00:00 (+1 day) is a period, and its settlement time would be at 00:00. All times mentioned above are Singapore Standard time (GMT+8).

（1）Orders can't be placed or cancelled during settlement period, error code "1056" will be returned if users place or cancel orders. 

You are recommended to request contract information by this two ways:

- restful, every few seconds during settlement period to access: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info
- websocket, Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication): public.$symbol.contract_info

It's in settlement time if there is any number of 5, 6, 7, 8 included in the returned status code of contract_status, while it indicates that settlement completed and users could place and cancel orders as usual if the returned status code is 1.

（2）When querying fund or position information during the settlement period, error codes will be returned. Error code and their meaning are as following:

1. Error code "1077" indicates that "the fund query of current perpetual swap trading pair failed during the settlement";
2. Error code "1078" indicates that "the fund query of part of perpetual swap trading pairs failed during the settlement";
3. Error code "1079" indicates that "the position query of current perpetual swap trading pair failed during the settlement";
4. Error code "1080" indicates that "the position query of part of perpetual swap trading pairs failed during the settlement";

You are recommended to read the status code from the returned message. If the above four types of status code appear, the returned data is not accurate and couldn't be used as reference.

### Q2: How to query the system status of the exchange?

There are two common statuses of the exchange systems: settlement/delivery in progress; suspended for maintenance; when the system is in these two kinds of statuses, the system will return the response error code and error information when calling the related API interfaces.

a.	How to judge whether the settlement/delivery has been done?

Users can judge from the value “contract_status” returned by the “Get Information of an Order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info); 

or Subscribe Contract Info (no authentication): public.$symbol.contract_info

If the return parameter contract_status is 1, it means that the settlement/delivery has been done and the trading has been resumed now.

b. How to judge whether the system is suspended for maintenance or not?

Users can judge from the value “heartbeat” pushed by the “Queried if system interface is available” interface (https://api.hbdm.com/heartbeat/) 

or the “Subscribe system status updates” interface ("topic: public.$service.heartbeat"); 

If the return parameter heartbeat is 1, it means that the system is available now and can be connected normally.


## Market and Websocket

### Q1: How often are the snapshot orderbook subscription and incremental orderbook subscription pushed?

The snapshot orderbook subscription(market.$contract_code.depth.$type) is checked once every 100MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed. It will be pushed at least 1 second.The incremental orderbook subscription is checked once every 30MS.If there is an update,it will be pushed.If there is no update, it will not be pushed.

### Q2: How often is the market trade subscription pushed?

The market trade subscription will be pushed when there is a transaction. 

### Q3: Are there historical Kline data or historical market trade data?

The historical kline data can be obtained via API interface /market/history/kline with the request params from, to (the time period cannot exceed two years). And the qty of data records cannot be exceeding 2000 in each time.

The historical trade data can be obtained by subscribing the websocket topic: market.$symbol.trade.detail 

or can be downloaded from <a href='https://futures.huobi.be/zh-cn/data/landing_page'>download historical market data</a > 

But also, you can download that data using <a href='https://github.com/hbdmapi/huobi_public_data'>The demo of downloading historical market data</a >

### Q4: How to get MACD and other technical indicators on Kline? 

The API does not have interfaces to get technical indicators such as MACD. You can refer to TradingView and other websites to calculate them.

### Q5: What is the definition of timestamp in the document? 

The timestamp in the document refers to the total number of seconds or total milliseconds from Greenwich Mean Time, January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (Beijing Time, January 1, 1970, 08:00:00) to the present.

### Q6: What is the definition of the 150 level and 20 level of MBP?


The Subscription of MBP data: market.$contract_code.depth.$type.150 price level means the current bids and asks splited into 150 level  by price.20 price level means the current bids and asks splited into 20 level by price.

### Q7: What is the meaning of merged depth when subscribing MBP data?

The subscrpition of MBP data:market.$contract_code.depth.$type：

step16 and step18 are merged by 7 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step17 and step19 are merged by 6 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step1 and step7 are merged by 5 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step2 and step8 are merged by 4 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step3 and step9 are merged by 3 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step4 and step10 are merged by 2 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step5 and step11 are merged by 1 decimal places.bids down,asks up.
step12 and step14 are combined by single digit.bids down,asks up.
step13 and step15 are combined by tens.bids down,asks up.

Example:

step4(0.01): 

bids price: 100.123, 100.245.
The merged bids price are 100.12, 100.24.

asks price: 100.123, 100.245
The merged asks price are 100.13, 100.25.

("Down" and "Up" are rounded up or down, if the price is down, the asks price is not rounded down, and the bids price is rounded up.)

150 price level: step0 to step5, step14 to step17；

20 price level: step6 to step13, step18, step19;

More examples：

step1(0.00001):

price: 1.123456
The merged bid price is 1.12345.
The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step7(0.00001):

price: 1.123456
The merged bid price is 1.12345.
The merged ask price is 1.12346.

step6(0.000001)

price: 1.123456
The merged bid price is 1.123456.
The merged ask price is 1.123456.

step11(0.1):

price: 1.123456
The merged bid price is 1.1.
The merged ask price is 1.1.

### Q8:Does websocket's position channel push full data or incrementall data each time? 

Subscription of position event: "positions.BTC-USDT".The latest position is pushed,including the volumes, available volumes, frozen volumes.If there is no update,it will not be pushed. 

### Q9: Does websocket's position channel push data when the unrealized profit is updated?

Subscription of position event: "positions.BTC-USDT".It will not be pushed  if only unrealized profit is updated.
It will be pushed only when position event is updated.

### Q10: What is the difference between market detail and trade detail in WS?

Market Detail(market.$contract_code.detail) is the merged market data. It will be checked every 0.5s,pushed once trade event updates,including the OHLCV data,etc.Trade Detail(market.$contract_code.trade.detail) is pushed once trade event updates,including trade price, trade volume, trade direction,etc.

### Q11: What is the meaning of the two ts pushed by subscription of incremental MBP ?

Subscription of incremental MBP：market.$contract_code.depth.size_${size}.high_freq，The outer ts is the timestamp when the market server sends the data.The inner ts is the timestamp when the orderbook is checked.

### Q12: What is the difference between websocket subscription of MBP and incremental MBP? How often is the incremental MBP pushed?

market.$contract_code.depth.$type is snapshot MBP data，market.$contract_code.depth.size_${size}.high_freq is incremental MBP data.Snapshot MBP data is checked every 100ms,pushed at least every 1s.Incremental MBP data is checked every 30ms.It will not be pushed,if MBP has no update.

### Q13: How to maintain local MBP data subscribing incremental MBP:market.$contract_code.depth.size_${size}.high_freq?

Snapshot MBP data will be pushed for the first time, and the incremental MBP data will be pushed afterwards.

(1) Compare the incremental price with the previous full MBP data, and replace the order amount with the same price;

(2) If the price is not in the local MBP data,add the price to the local MBP data;

(3) If a price level is gone, data such as [8100, 0] will be pushed.You have to remove the same price of local MBP data;

(4) For the same websocket connection, the incremental data version is incremented; if the version is not incremented, you need to re-subscribe and re-maintain the local full MBP data;

### Q14: What's the difference between "funding_rate" and "realized_rate" in the response of /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_historical_funding_rate interface?

Generally, "funding_rate" is equal to "realized_rate".Only when the payment of funding fee will cause the liquidation of the user's position, the funding fee is under or not charged(And the fee is the actual funding fee:"realized_rate").The current funding rate:"funding_rate" remains unchanged.

### Q15: When subscribing the same topic of several contract codes, will several ws be needed?

Since Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined swaps are different contracts with different interface addresses, different ws will be needed.

In Futures, Coin Margined swaps, USDT Margined swaps thereof, as long as the interface address is the same, one ws is enough.

### Q16: Is it available to place/cancel an order via WS??

Currently, it is not supported.

### Q17: How to subscribe order status?

a.	Successfully trade: “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.$contract_code)” or “Subscribe Order Data (orders.$contract_code)”

b.	Successfully cancel: Subscribe Account Equity Updates Data (accounts.$contract_code)

### Q18: What is the difference between the “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.$contract_code)” and “Subscribe Order Data (orders.$contract_code)”?

The pushed data of these two interfaces are different. Compared to “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.$contract_code)”, there are more fields for “Subscribe Order Data (orders.$contract_code)”

In general, the match order data (Subscribe Match Order Data “matchOrders.$contract_code”) may be pushed faster than the settled order data (Subscribe Order Data “orders.$contract_code”). 

The orders of forced liquidation and netting will not be pushed in “Subscribe Match Order Data (matchOrders.$contract_code)”

### Q19: How often is the “Subscribe Kline Data (market.$contract_code.kline.$period)” pushed?

If any transaction is completed, it will push every 500ms. If not, it will push according to the subscribe period

### Q20: How to judge whether the push is delayed?

Please first synchronize the time of the server through https://api.hbdm.com/api/v1/timestamp), and the “ts” in the returned data is timestamp (ms) and the corresponding time zone is UTC+8.

The outer layer of each pushed data has a “ts”, which represents the time stamp (ms) when the server pushes the data to the client and the corresponding time zone is UTC+8.

When the data pushed arrive, the procedure will record the local time “ts”. When the local time “ts” is much later than the pushing data “ts”, you can use the following methods to improve the delay:

a. Reduce the data pushed by reducing the number of WS subscriptions.

b. Check the stability and speed of the network between procedure and the servers (please replace api.btcgateway.pro with the domain name used by the program)

curl -o /dev/null -s -w time_namelookup"(s)":%{time_namelookup}"\n"time_connect"(s)":%{time_connect}"\n"time_starttransfer"(s)":%{time_starttransfer}"\n"time_total"(s)":%{time_total}"\n"speed_download"(B/s)":%{speed_download}"\n" api.btcgateway.pro

and you will receive data as below:

time_namelookup(s):0.001378

time_connect(s):0.128641

time_starttransfer(s):0.276588

time_total(s):0.276804

speed_download(B/s):2010.000

If you run the above command multiple times in a row, and the results obtained each time are very different, you can: a. Select an appropriate Huobi domain name, b. Optimize or reselect the network where the program is located.


## Order and Trade

### Q1: What's the reason for 1004 error code?

We notice that the system is sometimes overloaded when the market suddenly turns to be highly volatile. If the system is busy recently or the following prompts appear:

{“status”: “error”, “err_code”: 1004, “err_msg”: “System busy. Please try again later.”, “ts”:}

please be patient, and do not place or cancel order repeatedly during the process to avoid repeated orders and additional pressure on system performance. In the meanwhile, it is recommended to place and cancel orders through Web and APP.

### Q2: The same order ID and match ID can have multiple trades. for example: if a user take a large amount of maker orders, there will be multiple corresponding trades . How to identify these different trades ?

The field ID returned by the information interface /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail is a globally unique transaction identifier. if a maker order is matched multiple times, a trade will be pushed once there is a transaction matched.

### Q3: What is the delay for the round trip of huobi USDT Margined swap?

At present,it normally takes about 30-50ms from placing the order to getting the status of the order.

### Q4: Why does the API return connection reset or Max retris or Timeout error?

Most of the network connectivity problems ,(such as Connection reset or network timeout )  are caused by network instability , you can use the server in AWS Tokyo C area with api.hbdm.vn , which can effectively reduce network timeout errors.

### Q5: How to check the order status without order_id not returned?
 
 If the order_id couldn't be returned due to network problems, you can query the status of the order by adding the custom order number(client_order_id ).

### Q6: What to do if it's diconnected after the websocket subscription of account, order and positions for a while?
  
 When subscribing private accounts, orders and positions, the heartbeat should also be maintained regularly ,which is different from the market heartbeat format . Please refer to the "websocket Heartbeat and Authentication Interface" . if it is disconnected ,please try to reconnect.

### Q7: What is the difference between order status 1 and 2 ? what is the status 3 ?
 
 Status 1 is the preparation for submission. status 2 is the sequential submission  of internal process, which can be considered that it has been accepted by the system.  Status 3 indicated that the order has been  already submitted to market.

### Q8: Is there an interface to get the total assets in BTC of my account ? 
  
 No.

### Q9: Why is the order filled after the order is withdrawed successfully by placing API cancellation ?
  
 The success return of order cancellation or placement  only represents that the command is excuted successfully and doesn't mean that the order has been cancelled . You can check the order status through the interface /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info.

### Q10: Does the order status of 10 mean the order is failed?

Query the order status by /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info.If the status is 10,the order is failed。

### Q11: How long does it generally take for an API from withdrawing to cancelling successfully ?

The order cancellation command generally takes several tens of ms. The actual status of order cancellation can be obtained by invoking an interface: /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info

### Q12: How to get historical liquidation orders?

To obtain historical liquidation orders, you can access the one of two api interfaces: Get History Orders (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_hisorders【Isolated】or /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_cross_hisorders【Cross】), Get History Match Results (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_matchresults【Isolated】or /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_cross_matchresults【Cross】) with the return field order_source (order source) to judge. When order_source returns "risk", it means that this order is a liquidated order.

### Q13: Does Huob Futures support holding bi-directional position?

Yes, Huobi Futures supports long and short positions being held at the same time.

### Q14: How to ensure the order to be rapidly filled?

At present, Huobi Futures does not support market price when placing an order. To increase the probability of a transaction, users can choose to place an order based on BBO price (opponent), optimal 5 (optimal_5), optimal 10 (optimal_10), optimal 20 (optimal_20), among which the success probability of optimal 20 is the largest, while the slippage always is the largest as well.

It is important to note that the above methods will not guarantee the order to be filled in 100%. The system will obtain the optimal N price at that moment and place the order.

### Q15: How can API procedure be connected to the exchange more rapidly?

It’s recommended to use a AWS Tokyo c-zone server and the domain name “api.hbdm.vn” to connect to the system.

### Q16: It occurs an “abnormal service” error when transferring assets between spots and derivatives.

a. Check whether the request address is the address of Huobi Global : api.huobi.pro?

b. Check whether the precision of the coin does not exceed 8 decimal places? 

### Q17: How to confirm whether the position is opened or closed successfully?

Placing an order successfully through “Place an Order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order) or “Place a batch of orders” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_batchorder) just means the server has received your order placing instructions rather than you have opened/closed a position successfully.

You can check the order status by filling the returned “order_id” in the “Get Information of an Order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info) or the “Order Details Acquisition” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail); If the order has been filled, the “status” value in the return parameter will turn out 6 (wholly filled)

It is important to note:

a.	For “Get Information of an order” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info), after the settlement or delivery, the system will delete all the orders in ended status (5: partially filled orders have been cancelled; 6: wholly filled; 7: cancelled);

b.	There is a delay in “Order Details Acquisition” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail), so it is better to fill in “created_at” (order timestamp) and “order_type” (order type, fill in 1 by default). In this way, it will directly query the database, so the query results will be more timely.

### Q18: Why are orders canceled by the system automatically?

The order_price_type which can be chosen are IOC, FOK and Maker (Post Only). When the order book cannot meet with the corresponding conditions, the system will cancel the orders automatically:

Post_only: If the order placed is filled with an existing order on the order book immediately, the order will be cancelled to ensure the user is always a maker.

IOC order: If the order cannot be filled immediately, the unfilled part will be cancelled at once;

FOK order: If the order cannot be filled in its entirety, it will be wholly cancelled. No partial fulfillments are allowed.

### Q19: How to query the maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ current assets?

At present, we do not have an interface by which users can directly query the maximum amount (cont) available to open by using users’ the current asset.

### Q20: Are the “order_id” and “order_id_str” the same? 

The “order_id_str” is the string format of “order_id”, whose values are the same.

For the “order_id” with 18 bits, the “JSON.parse” in “nodejs” and “javascript” will be “int” by default, and mistakes will occur when analyzing. Thus, we advise using “order_id_str”.

### Q21: How to get the active buying/selling quantity in transaction data?

Users can get the data via “Query The Last Trade of a Contract” (/linear-swap-ex/market/trade) interface or by subscribing "sub": "market.$contract_code.trade.detail", thereinto

Amount refers to the trading volume (cont), which is the sum of the buying/selling volume; 

Direction refers to the active trading direction.

### Q22: The interval between “from” and “to” is “2000*period” when acquiring KLine data, then why the data obtained is []?

When acquiring the Kline data, the two time points “from” and “to” are contained, therefore it includes 2001 pieces of data. However, this exceeds the maximum limit 2000. Therefore, the system will return [].

Besides, the returned data will be [] as well if the interval between “from” and “to” exceeds 2 years.

### Q23: How to get the latest price?

There are two methods to get the latest price:

a. Invoking the “Get KLine Data(/linear-swap-ex/market/history/kline)” interface and filling in any “period”, the “close” of the last data in return data will be the latest price;

b. Invoking the “Query The Last Trade of a Contract(/linear-swap-ex/market/trade)” interface, the returned “price” will be the latest price.

### Q24: How to get the latest index price?

There are two methods to get the latest index price:

a.	Calling the “Get Contract Index Price Information” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_index), the returned “index_price” will be the latest index price.

b.	Calling the “Subscribe Index Kline Data” websocket (market.$contract_code.index.$period), the “close” of the last Kline data in returned data will be the latest index price.

### Q25: Will API upgrade affect the operation of the program?

In general, API upgrade will partly influence the ws disconnection. To avoid this, you can set up a ws-reconnect mechanism in advance; Please subscribe to the upgrade announcements for more details:

Coin-margined futures: https://status-dm.huobigroup.com/

Coin-margined swaps: https://status-swap.huobigroup.com/

USDT-margined swaps: https://status-linear-swap.huobigroup.com/

### Q26:  What does mean the “margin_balance” in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (api/v1/contract_account_info)?

”margin_balance” refers to the account equity

1. margin_balance = margin_static + profit_unreal

2. margin_balance = Account balance + profit_real + profit_unreal

Note: Account balance = margin_static - profit_real, there is only margin_static in the return data of api interface

Each of the two calculation methods above can get the margin_balance

### Q27: Is the “risk_rate” (margin rate) in “Query User’s Account Information” interface (/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_account_info) the same as the margin rate on WEB?

Yes, it is

When the “risk_rate” is less than or equal to 0, the position will be liquidated.


## Error Codes

### Q1: What is the reason for 1030 error code?

If you encounter errors such as {"status":"error","err_code":1030,"err_msg":"Abnormal service. Please try again later.","ts":1588093883199},indicating that your input request parameter is not correct, please print your request body and complete URL parameters, and please check the corresponding API document interface one by one.The common example is that the volume must be an integer. 

### Q2: What is the reason for 1048 error code?

If you encounter errors such as {'index': 1, 'err_code': 1048, 'err_msg': 'Insufficient close amount available.'}, indicating that your available position is not enough.You need to query the api /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_position_info to get your available position.

1. Check whether the amount (cont) of position-closing order exceeds the limit? (When there is limit order for closing a position, the quantity that available to be closed will be occupied; hence we kindly remind you to cancel these orders and try again.)

2. Check whether direction and offset are wrong as follows:

close long: sell to close a long position (direction: sell; offset: close);

close short: buy to close a short position (direction: buy; offset: close);

Only “direction” need to be uploaded when placing a flash close order (close long: sell; close short: buy). 

3. The pending take-profit and stop-loss (tp/sl) orders and trigger orders will not occupy the quantity of the position.

### Q3: What is the reason for 1032 error code? 

1032 means that your request exceeds the ratelimit. The coin margined swap, future and USDT margined swap limit the rate separately. Please check the ratelimit in the api ratelimit instructions, and you can print the current ratelimit in the header of the API response to check whether the ratelimit is exceeded. It is recommended to increase the request interval delay to avoid exceeding the ratelimit.

## The usage of and the difference between cross margin mode and isolated margin mode

1. Under the cross margin mode, all swaps share the USDT in the cross margin account as the margin, which indicates that all positions under the cross margin mode share the same account equity, and their PnL, occupied margin and margin ratio are calculated jointly. Under the isolated margin mode, the account equity for each swaps are calculated separately, and the position margin and PnL of each swaps will not affect each other. 

2. The cross margin mode and the isolated margin mode use different margin accounts, and the assets are independent of each other. Users can trade, or hold positions under the two modes at the same time. For example, in BTC/USDT swaps trading, the margin account for cross margin trading is USDT, while the margin account for isolated margin trading is BTC-USDT.

3. API users can use the support_margin_mode field (margin mode supported by the contract) of the API interface [Query Swap Info: linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info] to check which mode (cross/isolated) the contract supports.

4. The API interface is divided into three modes, [Cross], [Isolated] and [General]. These three modes are marked on the API interface name and the interface list. [Cross] indicates that the API interface only supports cross margin mode. [Isolated] indicates that the API interface only supports isolated margin mode, and [General] indicates that the API interface supports both two modes, indicating that it can be called by both the cross margin mode and isolated margin mode.

## How to solve problems more effectively?

When you report an API error, you need to attach your request URL, the original complete body of the request and the complete request URL parameters, and the original complete log of the server's response. If it is a websocket subscription, you need to provide the address of the subscription, the topic of the subscription, and the original complete log pushed by the server.

If it is an order-related issue, use the API order query interface /linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_info to keep the complete log returned and provide your UID and order number.


# Swap Market Data interface

## [General] Query Swap Info 

### Example              
                                   
- GET  `/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info`

```shell
curl "https://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_contract_info"      
```

#### Remarks

 - The interface supports cross margin mode and isolated margin mode.

 - The request parameter "support_margin_mode" should be "all" when querying the contract information which supports the cross margin mode and the isolated margin mode both. The value of "cross" or "isolated" just can query the contract information which only supports the cross margin mode or the isolated margin mode. Please keep attention.

## [General]Query account financial records via Multiple Fields

 - POST `/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_financial_record_exact`

#### Note：

 - The interface supports cross margin mode and isolated margin mode.

### Request Parameter
| Parameter Name        | Mandatory  | Type     | Description    | Value Range  |
| ----------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| margin_account      | true  | string | margin account                 | "BTC-USDT","USDT"(in cross mode)...                         |

| start_time   | false  | long    | start time(timestamp in millisecond)        | more detail sees the follow note    |
| end_time   | false  | long    | end time(timestamp in millisecond)        |  more detail sees the follow note   |
| from_id    | false | long    | from id(value from the query_id in return data)    |                     |
| size     | false | int    | size    |   default is 20, 50 at most                 |
| direct     | false | string    |  direct   |   prev/next；default is prev                          |

#### Note：
- Value range description of start_time and end_time:
   - start_time: value range is [(current time - 90 days)，current time] ；default value is clamp（end_time - 10 days，current time -90 days，current time -10 days）which means the furthest time is the current time minus 90 days and the most recent time is current time minus 10 days.
   - end_time: value range is [(current day - 90 days)，above++)，if the end_time is greater than the current time, use current time; if start_time is filled，the end_time shall be greater than start_time. The system will use current time by default.
- if from_id is not filled and the query direction is prev, query from back to front from the end time; if from_id is not filled and the query direction is next, query from front to back from the start time. Query financial records with creation time greater than or equal to the start time but less than or equal to the end time.
- if start_time, end_time and from_id all filled in，query according to from_id (but the data must between start_time and end_time)
- Regardless the query direction is prev or next, the data returned is reverse sorted by id.
- If the value of start_time or end_time filled in is not within the value range, the system will report that the parameter is invalid.
- Only data within 90 days are available to query.
- It needs contract_code parameter for request in cross margin mode when query the trading financial records of a certain contract market. And it not need contract_code parameter in other scenarios.

#### Note：
- When from_margin_account or to_margin_account is USDT, it means the transfer in or transfer out from cross margin account
- represents transfer from transfer_out margin account to transfer_in margin account. The currency transferred shall be the same as the denominated currency of the transfer_out margin account.；
- The denominated currency of the transfer_out margin account and transfer_in margin account must be the same. (eg, USDT can be transferred from BTC-USDT to ETH-USDT, but cannot be transferred from BTC-USDT to ETH-HUSD account).
- the rate limit between the master account and each subaccount is 10 times/ minute
- The client_order_id is valid in 8 hours only, that is the user cannot use the same client_order_id beyonds one times for the same transfer path (for example, transfer currency from master account to sub-account using client_order_id=1, and you can't do that transfe currency from master account to sub-account using client_order_id=1 in the next time; but you can 
  transfer currency from sub-account to  master account using client_order_id=1).

###  Note ： 

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value and the other don't need.

Post-Only orders are limit orders that will never take liquidity (also called maker-only order). There are order limit and position for post-only orders which the upper limit is 5,000,000 for open/close orders.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise, the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order, you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch Leverage interface. 

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the maker order will be cancelled.

open long: direction - buy、offset - open

close long: direction -sell、offset - close

open short: direction -sell、offset - open

close short: direction -buy、offset - close

No need to transfer BBO order price(ask 1 and bid 1) parameter, optimal_5: top 5 optimal BBO price, optimal_10：top 10 optimal BBO price, optimal_20：top 20 optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order, "post_only": maker order only (price data transfer is needed),IOC :Immediate-Or-Cancel Order,FOK:Fill-Or-Kill Order.

### Note

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make  mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

####  Note

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value and the other don't need.

Post-Only orders are limit orders that will never take liquidity (also called maker-only order). There are order limit and position for post-only orders which the upper limit is 5,000,000 for open/close orders.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise, the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order, you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch Leverage interface. 

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the maker order will be cancelled.

open long: direction - buy、offset - open

close long: direction -sell、offset - close

open short: direction -sell、offset - open

close short: direction -buy、offset - close

No need to transfer BBO order price(ask 1 and bid 1) parameter, optimal_5: top 5 optimal BBO price, optimal_10：top 10 optimal BBO price, optimal_20：top 20 optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order, "post_only": maker order only (price data transfer is needed),IOC :Immediate-Or-Cancel Order,FOK:Fill-Or-Kill Order.

### Note

"limit"，"post_only"，"ioc" and "fok" the four order price type need price value and the other don't need.

Description of post_only: assure that the maker order remains as maker order, it will not be filled immediately with the use of post_only, for the match system will automatically check whether the price of the maker order is higher/lower than the opponent first price, i.e. higher than bid price 1 or lower than the ask price 1. If yes, the maker order will placed on the orderbook, if not, the maker order will be cancelled.

If you’re holding a position currently, the leverage you choose when placing an order should be the same as the leverage of your current positions, otherwise, the order will fail to be placed. If you need a new leverage to place an order, you should switch the leverage of current positions first by using the Switch Leverage interface. 

Only open orders can support setting take profit and stop loss.

The take profit trigger price is a required field for setting a take profit order, and the stop loss trigger price is a required field for setting a stop loss order; if the trigger price field is not filled in, the corresponding take profit order or stop loss order will not be set.

No need to transfer BBO order price(ask 1 and bid 1) parameter, optimal_5: top 5 optimal BBO price, optimal_10：top 10 optimal BBO price, optimal_20：top 20 optimal BBO price (No need to transfer price data) ，limit": limit order, "post_only": maker order only (price data transfer is needed),IOC :Immediate-Or-Cancel Order,FOK:Fill-Or-Kill Order.

 - The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.

## [Isolated] Order details acquisition

- POST `/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_order_detail`

#### Remarks

 - This interface only supports isolated margin mode.

###  Request Parameter  

|   Parameter Name   |   Mandatory   |   Type   |   Desc                        |
| ------------------ | ------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| contract_code  |  true   |  string   |  Case-Insenstive.Both uppercase and lowercase are supported.e.g. "BTC-USDT"  |
| order_id           | true          | long     | Order ID                      |

| page_size          | false         | int      | Default 20，no more than 50   |

### Note

When getting information on order cancellation via query order detail interface, users who type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can query last 6-hour data, while users who don’t type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can only query last 2-hour data.

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make  mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

created_at should use timestamp of long type as 13 bits (include Millisecond), if send the accurate timestamp for "created_at", query performance will be improved.

eg. the timestamp "2019/10/18 10:26:22" can be changed：1571365582123.It can also directly obtain the timestamp（ts) from the returned ordering interface(swap_order) to query the corresponding orders.

Please note that created_at can't be "0"

#### Note:
 - The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each profit of order matched).
 - Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30, 2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value.  And the real profit (real_profit) of the transaction information that orders traded after December 10, 2020 has a value.


## [Cross] Get Detail Information of order

 - POST `/linear-swap-api/v1/swap_cross_order_detail`

#### Remarks

 - The interface only supports cross margin mode.

###  Request Parameter

| Parameter Name       | Mandatory  | Type     | Desc | Data Value  |
| ---------- | ----- | ------ | ---------------------------- | ---- |
| contract_code     | true  | string | contract code| "BTC-USDT"...     |
| order_id   | true  | long   | order ID                         |      |
| created_at | false  | long   | created timestamp                        |      |
| order_type | false  | int    | order type | 1. Quotation; 2. Cancelled order; 3. Forced liquidation; 4. Delivery Order |
| page_index | false | int    | page number, default 1st page                    |      |
| page_size  | false | int    | default 20，no more than 50                |      |

### Note

When getting information on order cancellation via query order detail interface, users who type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can query last 6-hour data, while users who don’t type in parameters “created_at” and “order_type” can only query last 2-hour data.

The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make  mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by jaso-bigint package.

created_at should use timestamp of long type as 13 bits (include Millisecond), if send the accurate timestamp for "created_at", query performance will be improved.

eg. the timestamp "2019/10/18 10:26:22" can be changed：1571365582123.It can also directly obtain the timestamp（ts) from the returned ordering interface(swap_order) to query the corresponding orders.

Please note that created_at can't be "0"

### Note
 - The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make  mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.
 - The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each profit of order matched).
 - Only of the order information that orders created after 0:00 on January 30, 2021, the real profit (real_profit) parameter has a value. And in the other orders created before that times, it is 0.

## [Cross] Get History Orders

   - start_time: value range is [(current time - 90 days)，current time] ；default value is clamp（end_time - 10 days，current time -90 days，current time -10 days）which means the furthest time is the current time minus 90 days and the most recent time is current time minus 10 days.
   - end_time: value range is [(current day - 90 days)，above++)，if the end_time is greater than the current time, use current time; if start_time is filled，the end_time shall be greater than start_time. The system will use current time by default.
- if from_id is not filled and the query direction is prev, query from back to front from the end time; if from_id is not filled and the query direction is next, query from front to back from the start time. Query financial records with creation time greater than or equal to the start time but less than or equal to the end time.
- Regardless the query direction is prev or next, the data returned is reverse sorted by query_id.
- If the value of start_time or end_time filled in is not within the value range, the system will report that the parameter is invalid.
- Only data within 90 days are available to query.

####  Query cases are as below (special cases are not included)：
| start_time | end_time | from_id  | size | direct | Query Result |

### Notice
 - If users don’t upload/fill the page_index or page_size, it will automatically be set as the default value of the top 20 data on the first page, for more details, please follow the parameters illustration.
 - The return order_id is 18 bits, it will make  mistake when nodejs and JavaScript analysed 18 bits. Because the Json.parse in nodejs and JavaScript is int by default. so the number over 18 bits need be parsed by json-bigint package.
 - The real_profit is calculated with the average price in open position and the transaction average price in close position (the real profit is the sum of each profit of order matched).
 - The real profit (real_profit) parameter that orders created after December 10, 2020 has a value. And before that time it is 0.

   - start_time: value range is [(current time - 90 days)，current time] ；default value is clamp（end_time - 10 days，current time -90 days，current time -10 days）which means the furthest time is the current time minus 90 days and the most recent time is current time minus 10 days.
   - end_time: value range is [(current day - 90 days)，above++)，if the end_time is greater than the current time, use current time; if start_time is filled，the end_time shall be greater than start_time. The system will use current time by default.
- if from_id is not filled and the query direction is prev, query from back to front from the end time; if from_id is not filled and the query direction is next, query from front to back from the start time. Query financial records with creation time greater than or equal to the start time but less than or equal to the end time.
- Regardless the query direction is prev or next, the data returned is reverse sorted by query_id.
- If the value of start_time or end_time filled in is not within the value range, the system will report that the parameter is invalid.
- Only data within 90 days are available to query.

## API Rate Limit Illustration

There is rate limit for both public and private interfaces. More details are laid out as below:

- Generally, the private interface rate limit of API key is at most 72 times every 3 seconds for each UID (Trade Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds. Read Interface: at most 36 times every 3 seconds) (this rate limit is shared by all the altcoins contracts delivered by different date).

- For public interfaces used to get information of non-market data (such as request information of index, price limit, delivery and settlement, positions, etc.), the rate limit for each IP is 120 times every 3 seconds. (Please note that the 120 times/3s rate limit is shared by all the requests for non-market data under this UID)

- For public interface to get market data such as  Get Kline data, Get Market Data Overview, Get Contract Information,Get market in-depth data, Get premium index Kline, Get real-time forecast capital rate kline, Get basis data, Get the last Trade of a Contract and so on：

   (1) For restful interfaces, products,  (future, coin margined swap, usdt margined swap)800 times/second for one IP at most
　　
   (2) The rate limit for “req” request is 50 times/s at most. No limit for “sub” request as the data will be pushed by server voluntarily. 

- The order push private WebSocket interface requires API Key for authentication.

    Each UID can create 30 WS connections at most for private order push at the same time. The user under this UID only need to subscribe one WS order push for the contracts of the same underlying coins. For example, users only need to create one WS order push connection for BTC Contract, which our system will automatically push orders of BTC weekly, BTC biweekly and BTC quarterly contracts via this connection.

Note: The rate limit of WS order push and RESTFUL private interface are separated from each other with no relations.

- 40 subscriptions at most can be sent in one second in websocket connections.

Response the following strings for “Header” via API

- ratelimit-limit： the upper request limit per time, unit: times

- ratelimit-interval： reset interval(reset the number of request ), unit: ms

- ratelimit-remaining： available request number left in this round, unit: times

- ratelimit-reset： upper limit of reset time used to request number， unit: ms


# WebSocket Heartbeat and Authentication Interface

## Market Heartbeat
WebSocket API supports two-way heartbeat. Both Server and Client can send ping message, which the opposite side can return with pong message.

- WebSocket Server sends heartbeat：

`{"ping": 18212558000}`

- WebSocket Client should respond:：

`{"pong": 18212558000}`

Note: Once the WebSocket Client and WebSocket Server get connected, the server will send a heartbeat every 5 seconds (the frequency might change). The connection will get disconnected automatically if the WebSocket Client ignores the heartbeat message for 5 times. The server will remain connection if the WebSocket Client responds one “ping” value within the latest 2 heartbeat messages.

## Order Push Heartbeat

### WebSocket API supports one-way heartbeat. The Server initiates ping message and the Client will return pong message. The Server sends back a heartbeat:

`{`

  `"op": "ping",`
  
  `"ts": "1492420473058"`
  
`}`

- WebSocket Client should return:

`{`

  `"op": "pong",`
  
  `"ts": "1492420473058"`
  
`}`

### Note

- "ts" value in the return "pong" message is the "ts" value from "ping" push Once the WebSocket Client and WebSocket Server connected, Websocket Server will send a heartbeat every 5 seconds (the frequency might change) to Wesocket Client. If WebSocket Client ignores the heartbeat message for 5 times, it will get disconnected with Websocket Sever automatically. Under abnormal conditions, WebSocket Server will return error message like:

`{`

  `"op": "pong"`

  `"ts": "1492420473027",`
  
  `"err-code": 2011,`
  
  `"err-msg": “detailed error message”`

`}`

- Websocket Server disconnects automatically During period of building connection and authentication, Websocket Server will disconnect automatically if there is any error. The data structure before closing pushing are as below:

`{`

  `"op": "close", // indicate Websocket Server disconnected automatically`
   
  `"ts": long   // The local timestamp of Server push`
  
`}`

- Server return error but remain connection After successful authentication, Server will return error but not disconnect if Client provides illegal Op or there is any internal error.

`{`

  `"op": "error", // indicate that receive illegal Op or internal error`
  
  `"ts": long// The local timestamp of Server push`
  
`}`

## Order Push Address

- Huobi USDT Margined Swap uses one official address:

  `wss://api.hbdm.com/linear-swap-notification`

### Note

If you can't connect "https://api.hbdm.com", please use "https://api.btcgateway.pro" for debug purpose. If your server is deployed in AWS, we recommend using "https://api.hbdm.vn".

Please note that the WS request connection should not go over 30 normally.

### Data Compression

All response data from WebSocket server are compressed into GZIP format. Clients have to decompress them for further use.

### Illustration of Request(req and rep) Data

- Character Encoding：UTF-8

- Case sensitive，including parameter name and return parameter

- Data type： use JSON to transmit data

- All request data has fixed format. Please note that Huobi USDT Margined Swap API document will only focus on data illustration in non-fixed format.

> Request data format is laid out as below:

```

  {
  "op": string, // Required; Client requests operator name (Server will returns the same value), For detailed operator name list, please refer to the appendix
  "cid": string, // Optional;Request unique ID( Client generate a unique ID which server will return the same value)
  // Others required/ Optional string
  }

```

> All responses push data will be returned in fixed format，Huobi USDT Margined Swap API document will only focus on data illustration， Response data format is laid out as below；

```
   
  {
  "op": string, // Required; Clients request operator name
  "cid": string, // optional; Client requests unique ID
  "ts": long, // required; Server responds local timestamp
  "err-code": integer, // required; return error code, “0” means successfully responded, others means error. For detailed return error code list, please refer to appendix
  "err-msg": string, only responds error message when error occurs, detailed error information. 
  "data": object // optional; return data object， request valid data after error removed 
  }
  
 ```

>  Push Data Format is laid out as below:

```

  {
  "op": "string", // required;Server pushes operator name, For detailed operator type list, please refer to appendix
  "ts": long, // required; Server pushes local timestamp
  "data": object // required;return data object
  }
  
```

## Server voluntarily disconnects connection

During making connection and authentication, server will disconnect connection automatically when error occurs. Before disconnecting, server will send notification below,

`{`

  `"op": "close", // represents server disconnect connection voluntarily
   
  `"ts": long   // Server pushes local timestamp
  
`}`


## Server return error code but remain connection

After authentication, if clients encountered internal error or request data out from Operator List, WebSocket server will return error message. But server will remain connection

`{`

  `"op": "error", // means server receive data out from Operator List or clients got internal error `
  
  `"ts": long// Server pushes local timestamp`
  
`}`

## Authentication

Clients can create Access Key and Secret Key on Huobi which Access Key is the API access key kept by the client.  The Secret Key is used to sign the request (available only for request). To apply/change API key, please go to “Account-API Management” on Huobi USDT Margined Swap. Make name for the API Key and click “create” to finish. It’s optional to bind IP address to the API Key.

For the Trade WebSocket interface, server have to do authentication for topics require authentication before making connection. 

Note: These two keys are closely related to account security and should not be disclosed to others at any time.

### Authentication Format Example:

`{`

  `"op": "auth",`
  
  `"type": "api",`
  
  `"AccessKeyId": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",`
  
  `"SignatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",`
  
  `"SignatureVersion": "2",`
  
  `"Timestamp": "2017-05-11T15:19:30",`
  
  `"Signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=",`
  
`}`

| Field        | type  | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| op               | string | required； Operator type， Requested authentication operator type is auth                             |
| type             | string | required； Signature method  sign via API means API interface signature, sign via ticket means terminal signature        |
| cid              | string | Optional； Client requests the unique ID                                      |
| AccessKeyId      | string |required if users use API signature； API Access key is the API AccessKey you applied. |
| SignatureMethod  | string | required if users use API signature； Signature method, user computes signature basing on the protocol of hash ,the API uses HmacSHA256 |
| SignatureVersion | string | required if the users use API signature； the signature protocol version, the API uses 2           |
| Timestamp        | string | required if users use API signature； timestamp, the time you request(UTC timezone)  this value can help to avoid request data interception by the third party for example ：2017-05-11T16:22:06 (UTC time zone)
|  Signature        | string | required if the users use API signature； signature, the value computed is ensure valid authentication without being tampered |
| ticket           | string | required if users use ticket signature ； return when logged in                            |

#### Notice：

- To decrease API access rate, the WebSocket server uses the same signature algorithm with that on REST API 

- All data is case sensitive;

- When type is api, In API authentication, parameter op, type, cid, Signature do not participate in operation.

- The request method in signature's method is GET, the other parameter please refer to REST api document

#### Signature Illustration：

Example on Signature Computing Process:，

- Request code requirement for signature computing. Because it can return to total different data with different content when using HMAC for signature computing; Before signature computing, clients need to sign by following the standard format.


- Request Method (GET or POST), add newline character `\n` after URL

  `GET\n`

- add visit address with lowercase letters, add newline characters `\n` after URL

  `api.hbdm.com\n`

- Access path, adding newline character `\n` after URL

  `/linear-swap-notification\n`

- Sequence the parameter name according to ASCII code (use UTF-8 and transfer into URI encoding, capital letters for hexadecimal characters. E.G.: ‘:’ will be encoded into '%3A', blank will be encoded into '%20'). Here is an encoding example below for request parameters

  `AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`
  

- Connect all parameters with ’&’ according to the sequence above.
 
- The final strings for signature computing created by following the steps as below:
  
 Signature Computing, transmit the two parameters below into cryptographic hash: strings needed to be computed, API SecretKey. Get the signature computing result and get it encoded with Base 64 code standard. 

Add computed value into the Signature parameter in API request. Please note  the computed value SHOULD NOT be encoded into URL cdoe.
